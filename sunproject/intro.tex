In this Data Analysis project the aim was to obtain and plot data reflecting
sun-spots and cosmic-rays. In fore-thought the assumption was that there would
be some correlation between the measured values for sun-spots versus 
cosmic-rays. To acheive this, data for each was obtained from the NOAA site
with a specific time interval and relative region. 
Using Python this data was filtered and restructed into arrays. Once in a
workable format, the structed data was smoothed using a PyAstronomy package.
Using the original and smoothed data arrays a plot was created reflecting the
data counts as a function of time in months. With a step period of a month for
each data value. After plotting the data reflects an indirect correlation 
between the observed number of sun-spots and the cosmic-ray count in a relative
region.
