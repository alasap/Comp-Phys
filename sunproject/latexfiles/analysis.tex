In Figure \ref{fig:sundata} the data curves reflect the assumption of an
inverse cause-affect relationship between cosmic-rays and sunspots.
In this figure the gray spikes correspond to the data-set obtained
from NOAA. While the blue curves represent the moving average of each data-set.
The directness of this correlation is further defined by the red and black
dots with each corresponding to the same color below.
\par Visually these dots still adhere to the correlation, however not all of
the extrema lie directly verticle to one another. Suggesting that this 
relationship is not a direct cause and affect. Table \ref{tbl:timegap} is 
utilized in exploring this connection. The average time-gap between extrema
is about $8.4$ Months. Meaning that sunspot's reach a minimum/maximum about
$255$ days before an extrema is observed in the cosmic-ray data.
