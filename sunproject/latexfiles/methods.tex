\par Using the files from the NOAA repository the data files were read and 
restructured with python to remover extraneous data. With proper structuring
the data was then smoothed through the use of a moving average since the 
original data contains high fluctuations within the data set.\\
\par The moving average data-set was utilized in two manners. 
Visual use came through the contruction of a dual-plot representing
the cosmicrays and sunspots over the course of $50$ years. Then it was used
numerically to determine the relative maximum's and minimum's within a time
period. After determining the relative extrema the time difference between
their occurances was tabulated and averaged.
