abstract = {Effective Computation in Physics is a handy guide to the types of problems you run into with computational physicsâ€”such as version control, bash scripts, object orientation, large databases, and parallel machines. The authors provide detailed scientific computing motivations, clear and concise tutorials, and references to further information about each of the topics presented. This book fills the existing training gap for students and scientists who conduct physics in a world where simulations have replaced desktop experiments and sophisticated data traversing algorithms have replaced pen and paper analysis. Provides a central source that ties various pieces of computational physics together Contains coverage of the Python programming language aimed toward physicists Helps you properly analyze and compellingly visualize your data Includes chapters on hot topics like NumPy and HDF5 PapersGroups},
