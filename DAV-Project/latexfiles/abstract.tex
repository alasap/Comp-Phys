\hspace{0.6cm}The inverse correlation between sunspots and cosmic-rays is a known occurance.
However,
in this data-analysis and visualization project the aim was to establish a 
correlation time between cosmic-rays and sunspots. Utilizing observational
data over a fifty year period, a visual representation of this correlation
was created. Furthermore, computational analysis of the cause-affect gap
shows an averaged lag between sunspots and cosmic-rays.
