\par While the relationship between sunspots and cosmicrays is well established,
this data analysis project aimed to visually
and quanitatively represent the cause-affect relationship joining sunspots with
cosmic rays.\\
\par To acheive this, data for a specific time interval and region was 
obtained from the NOAA repositories affording a quanitative analysis.\cite{raydata} \cite{spotdata}
Using python, each data-set was filtered and
restructed for analysis. The data reflects and indirect correlation between
sunspots and cosmicray. Also, in computing the correlation time between
each corresponding maximum and minimum yielded an average suggesting
a statistical gap between the two occurances.
