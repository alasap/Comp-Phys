@article{Svensmark2016,
abstract = {A method is developed to rank Forbush decreases (FDs) in the galactic cosmic ray radiation according to their expected impact on the ionization of the lower atmosphere. Then a Monte Carlo bootstrap-based statistical test is formulated to estimate the significance of the apparent response in physical and microphysical cloud parameters to FDs. The test is subsequently applied to one ground-based and three satellite-based data sets. Responses ({\textgreater}95{\%}) to FDs are found in the following parameters of the analyzed data sets. AERONET: {\AA}ngstr{\"{o}}m exponent (cloud condensation nuclei changes), SSM/I: liquid water content, International Satellite Cloud Climate Project (ISCCP): total, high, and middle, IR-detected clouds over the oceans, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS): cloud effective emissivity, cloud optical thickness, liquid water, cloud fraction, liquid water path, and liquid cloud effective radius. Moreover, the responses in MODIS are found to correlate positively with the strength of the FDs, and the signs and magnitudes of the responses agree with model-based expectations. The effect is mainly seen in liquid clouds. An impact through changes in UV-driven photo chemistry is shown to be negligible and an impact via UV absorption in the stratosphere is found to have no effect on clouds. The total solar irradiance has a relative decrease in connection with FDs of the order of 10−3, which is too small to have a thermodynamic impact on timescales of a few days. The results demonstrate that there is a real influence of FDs on clouds probably through ions.},

@techreport{Sierra-Porta2019,
abstract = {In the present paper a systematic study is carried out to validate the similarity or degree of relationship between daily terrestrial cosmic rays intensity and three characteristics of about evolution of solar corona, like a number of sunspots and flare index observed in the solar corona and to Ap index for regular magnetic field variation caused by regular solar radiation changes. The study is made in a range including three solar cycles starting with the cycle 21 (year 1976) and ending on cycle 23 (year 2008). The technique used in this case will be the use of the cross-correlation technique to establish patterns and dependence on the behavior of both variables. This study focused on the time lag calculation for these variables and found a maximum of negative correlation over CC1 ≈ 0.85, CC2 ≈ 0.75 and CC3 ≈ 0.63 with an estimation of 181, 156 and 2 days of deviation between maximum/minimum of peaks for the intensity of cosmic rays related with sunspot number, flare index and Ap index regression, respectively.},
